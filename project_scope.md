Project Scope: Exoplanet Discovery Prediction
1. Project Goal
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to NASA’s Kepler exoplanet dataset to build a model that can predict whether a star hosts an exoplanet based on its observed features. This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate the data analysis and machine learning skills I have acquired through the Codecademy ML Foundations course.

2. Data
The dataset used will be the publicly available Kepler NASA dataset, which contains observations of stars including various features such as brightness, temperature, transit data, and whether the star has a confirmed exoplanet or not.

3. Key Features
The analysis will focus on features such as:

Stellar brightness

Temperature

Transit duration and depth

Other relevant star and transit parameters available in the dataset

4. Approach
Data cleaning and wrangling to prepare the dataset for analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations

Feature selection and engineering if needed

Building and training classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, decision trees)

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics

Documenting insights and potential next steps

5. Expected Outcome
A trained machine learning model capable of predicting exoplanet presence with reasonable accuracy

Insights into which features most influence the model’s predictions

A well-documented Jupyter Notebook showcasing the entire process from data loading to modeling

A project repository on GitHub that demonstrates version control and project organization

6. Constraints and Challenges
Handling missing or inconsistent data

Potential class imbalance between stars with and without exoplanets

Limited computational resources and time for training complex models
